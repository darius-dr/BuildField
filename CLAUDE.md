# Business Context

## Overview
Product-led growth partner for businesses that need product expertise but not a full team. Combines strategic product thinking with hands-on execution.

## Positioning
**One-liner:** "Product expertise. Growth unlocked."

**What we are:** A product-minded partner for growth-stage businesses
**What we do:** Apply product thinking to unlock growth—whether that's fixing leaky funnels or launching new products
**Who we serve:** Established businesses with PMF that need product expertise but not a full team

**Differentiation:** We think like product people first. Most agencies are design-focused (pretty but doesn't convert), dev-focused (functional but no strategy), or marketing-focused (traffic without substance). We sit at the intersection—diagnose real problems, prioritize ruthlessly, then execute.

## Two Service Lanes

### Lane 1: Optimize
**For:** Products that exist but underperform
**Problem:** Website/app/funnel has traffic but conversions leak out
**Solution:** Audit → Diagnose → Fix → Measure
**Services:**
- Conversion audits & optimization
- UX/UI improvements
- Performance optimization
- Funnel analysis & fixes
- A/B testing strategy

### Lane 2: Launch
**For:** Products that need to exist
**Problem:** Validated idea or business need, no internal capacity to ship
**Solution:** Strategy → Design → Build → Validate
**Services:**
- MVP strategy & scoping
- Product design
- Web & mobile development
- Landing pages & marketing sites
- Launch support & iteration

## Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

### Good Fit
1. **Growth-stage companies**
   - Revenue $500K–$10M
   - Found product-market fit
   - No dedicated product team
   - Know something's broken but not what

2. **Teams launching new products**
   - Need to move fast
   - Want strategy, not just execution
   - Looking for a partner, not a vendor

### Not a Fit
- Looking for the cheapest option
- Need someone to "just build what we say"
- Want a one-off project with no iteration

## Founder Background
- Experienced Product Manager
- Capable of design and development
- Product strategy and validation expertise
- Outsources complex technical work when needed (not exposed to clients)
- Goal: Attract clients deliverable personally, outsource when lacking skill or time

## Value Propositions

### 1. Product Thinking, Not Just Execution
"Most agencies take orders. We diagnose problems first. We'll tell you what to build—and more importantly, what not to build."

### 2. Ship Fast, Learn Faster
"Weeks, not months. We move like a startup because waiting costs you money. Launch, measure, iterate."

### 3. Outcomes Over Outputs
"We don't celebrate launched projects. We celebrate moved metrics. Every decision tied to growth."

## Business Model
- **Entry point:** Free audit with prioritized recommendations (demonstrates expertise, creates urgency)
- **Pricing:** Competitive initially to get first clients, evolving to premium/boutique positioning
- **Premium signals:**
  - "We take on 2-3 projects at a time to ensure deep focus"
  - "You work directly with senior product expertise, not junior account managers"
  - "We're selective about who we work with. Fit matters."
- **Geography:** Local-first to start, not limited geographically

## 2-Year Vision
Known as a product professional/agency that unlocks growth through product, not just marketing.

## Sales Motion
1. **Wedge:** Free/paid visual audit with prioritized recommendations
   - Demonstrates expertise before commitment
   - Creates urgency (they see problems they didn't know existed)
   - Positions as advisor, not vendor
   - Low risk for them to say yes

2. **Expansion:** Once in, can do optimization, new builds, app work, strategy—whatever they need
